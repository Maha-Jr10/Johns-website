                        <h2>Early Foundation</h2>
                        <p>I embarked on my educational journey at the tender age of 3, starting at <strong>Vine Excellent School</strong>, where I laid a solid foundation in academics from Nursery 1 to Grade 2. Recognizing my potential, I transitioned to <strong>LightHouse School</strong> for Grades 3 to 5, where my performance stood out, and I skipped a grade due to my exceptional academic aptitude.</p>

                        <h2>Junior Secondary</h2>
                        <p>In 2016, I began my high school education at <strong>New Covenant School</strong>, completing Grades 7 through 9 by 2018. My dedication and hard work paid off when I graduated from Junior School as the <strong>best student</strong>, earning the privilege to join one of the most prestigious academic environments in The Gambiaâ€”<strong>Nusrat Senior Secondary School</strong>.</p>

                        <p>At Nusrat, I joined the esteemed <strong>Science 1 class</strong>, where I completed Grades 10 to 12. In 2021, I graduated high school from Nusrat with <strong>strong grades</strong>, making me a strong candidate for competitive scholarship applications. This milestone set the stage for my higher education journey.</p>

                        <h2>University Studies</h2>
                        <p>In 2022, I commenced my university studies at the <strong>University of The Gambia (UTG)</strong> as a Computer Science student. Later that year, I was fortunate to secure a scholarship to pursue my education at <strong>ENSAF</strong> (Ã‰cole Nationale des Sciences AppliquÃ©es de FÃ¨s) one of the most competitive schools in <strong>Morocco</strong>. Despite arriving late in the academic cycle and now having lectures in French, I managed to successfully validate the preparatory stages, showcasing my resilience and adaptability. Today, I am specializing in <strong>Data Science and AI Engineering</strong>, aligning perfectly with my career aspirations.</p>
